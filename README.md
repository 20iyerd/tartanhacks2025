## Changing the Tide of Transit Carbon Emissions
In the era of climate change solutions, electric vehicles are touted by many as a panacea. However,
the environmental impacts of lithium mining and the use of non-renewable energy sources for
charging make EVs a more stopgap solution, rather than a long-term one. With this project, I hope
to create a tool that can be used by advocacy groups 
approach to electrifying modes of mass transit within the United States, drawing from historical
perspectives and current public policy. I believe that implementing reliable, accessible public
transit is one of the most underexplored and consequential ways to reduce carbon emissions, and
that the United States has a lot of potential in this space. This paper will provide a perspective
that can be used in this journey to reducing emissions and combating climate change.
